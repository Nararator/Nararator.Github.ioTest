## About Me

Hi, my names Vincenzo! I’ve always been fascinated by how technology works, which led me to experiment with coding in Lua on Roblox at a young age. I loved the troubleshooting process and the satisfaction of seeing things come together. This curiosity and passion evolved into an interest in cybersecurity, where I focus on solving complex problems and understanding the technical aspects behind computer systems.

Currently, I’m in college working toward my CompTIA A+ and CompTIA Network+ certifications. I’ve also built a project simulating a company with 100 users, where I set up shared folders, software installations, backups, and audits, honing my practical skills in the field.

I’m excited to continue learning and growing in cybersecurity and look forward to contributing to real-world challenges.
